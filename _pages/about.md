# Junoh Kang
I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [SNU Computer Vision Lab](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/).
I aim to solve problems of machine learning in a theoretically concrete manner by leveraging my expertise: mathematics applied to problem description and solution.
<!-- I am currently working on diffusion models. -->
My primary research interest is diffusion models and I am also interested in the efficiency of neural networks.

Besides the research, I am also interested in economics, investment, and playing sports such as tennis, golf, futsal, and boxing.

<!-- I am currently working on diffusion models. -->
<!-- My expertise would be summarized as mathematics applied to problem description and solution.

Here is a detailed description of what I have done so far during my PhD period:
While my primary interest is enhancing sampling speed in diffusion models, I am also interested in diffusion models in general.
