# Junoh Kang
I am a second year Ph.D. student at the [SNU Computer Vision Lab](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/).
I aim to solve problems of machine learning and computer vision in a theoretically concrete manner, more than just heuristics.
My primary research interest is diffusion models and I am also interested in the efficiency of neural networks.

I am also interested in economics, quant investment, and playing sports such as tennis, golf, futsal, and boxing.
