# Junoh Kang
I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [SNU Computer Vision Lab](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/).
I aim to solve problems of deep learning in a theoretically concrete manner by leveraging my expertise: mathematics applied to problem description and solution.
My primary research interest is generative models. 
<!-- Specifically, I am interested in 1) *unlearning generative models for privacy*, 2) *imposing more controllability for video generation*, and 3) *accelerating video generative models*. -->

Besides the research, I am also interested in economics, investment, and playing sports such as tennis, golf, and futsal.
